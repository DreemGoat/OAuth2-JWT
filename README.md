# OAuth2-JWT
Group assignment: Implement FE + BE with OAuth2 and JWT + Database. 
We decided to take Group Fontaine's final project react app front end for the implementation. 


# Team Contributions 
- Daniel: attempted implementing the OAuth2
- Filbert: attempted creating JWT
- Jocelin: created the UI for login, home navigation and logout button
- Tiffany: created the database with SQLite. Also created another database but with the JWT files (+ API endpoints) too. Connected both database and JWT together although there are some conflicts with the database column foreign key table. Helped with fixing the navigations for front end.

# Folder Guides
- meow: consists of the database only. You can try running uvicorn to see how the data is stored succesfully.
- backend: consists of the database and JWT files. You can try running uvicorn to see how the access token can be generated.
